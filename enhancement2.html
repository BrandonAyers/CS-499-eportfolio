    <p>
        <strong>Artifact Description:</strong><br>
        This artifact is the CS-340 dashboard project updated to demonstrate my understanding and use of algorithms and data structures. I focused on filtering, sorting, and managing table data efficiently, implementing better logic for handling dynamic user input and selection.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong><br>
        I included this artifact because it showcases my skills in using algorithms to process and manage data efficiently. I applied data structure concepts by structuring data for fast lookups, filtering, and selection, using pandas DataFrames and efficient callback handling. These enhancements improved responsiveness and reliability, highlighting my problem-solving skills and technical knowledge in algorithms.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Reflection on the Process:</strong><br>
        While improving this artifact, I learned how optimizing data processing logic can make a significant difference in real-time applications. A challenge was ensuring that selections and filters applied correctly without duplicating data or causing errors. I overcame this by using careful indexing and conditional logic, which strengthened my understanding of algorithmic thinking and data structure usage.

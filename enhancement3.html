    <h1>Enhancement 3 – Databases</h1>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Artifact Description:</strong><br>
        This artifact demonstrates my use of databases in the CS-340 dashboard project. I enhanced the project by integrating MongoDB for data storage and retrieval, implementing search functionality, and improving indexing for performance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong><br>
        I included this artifact because it shows my ability to work with databases, retrieve data efficiently, and connect a backend database to a user-facing dashboard. Enhancements included MongoDB integration, text search capabilities, and more structured queries. This illustrates my database management skills and understanding of connecting front-end interfaces with back-end storage.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Reflection on the Process:</strong><br>
        While working on this artifact, I learned how to structure queries for efficient retrieval and how to handle dynamic filtering with a database backend. Challenges included mapping user selections to MongoDB queries and ensuring the dashboard remained responsive. I overcame this by careful testing and structuring the callbacks to maintain performance and reliability. The artifact now demonstrates skills in database management and application integration.

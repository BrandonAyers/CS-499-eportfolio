    <h1>Enhancement 1 – Software Engineering</h1>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Artifact Description:</strong><br>
        This artifact is my original dashboard project from CS-340, created during my Advanced Programming Concepts course. The project started as a simple dashboard displaying animal data with static filters and tables. My goal was to improve its structure, functionality, and usability, enhancing it for real-world applications.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Justification for Inclusion:</strong><br>
        I included this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to analyze existing code, refactor it for better design, and implement improvements that increase maintainability and usability. I applied software engineering principles such as modularity, proper commenting, and separation of concerns. Enhancements included adding dynamic filters, improving the layout, and restructuring the callbacks for clarity and performance. This showcased my problem-solving skills, logical design thinking, and code organization abilities.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Reflection on the Process:</strong><br>
        While enhancing this artifact, I learned the importance of planning the architecture before implementing features. A key challenge was managing dependencies between the DataTable, graphs, and map, ensuring that updates flowed correctly. I overcame this by carefully reviewing callback dependencies and restructuring the code. The artifact now aligns more closely with professional standards and demonstrates course outcomes related to software design, problem-solving, and system organization.

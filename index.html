    <h1>CS 499 Capstone ePortfolio</h1>
    
    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    
    <p>
    Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has given me the opportunity to reflect on how much I have grown both technically and professionally. When I began this program, I was focused on simply learning how to code. Over time, my perspective shifted from just writing working code to designing solutions that are structured, efficient, secure, and maintainable. This capstone represents that growth and demonstrates how I now approach problems with a broader engineering mindset.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    As someone transitioning into a career as a Test Engineer, I have developed a strong appreciation for software quality, validation, and structured design. Throughout the program, I learned that writing code is only one part of the process. Ensuring that it behaves correctly, handles edge cases, performs efficiently, and protects data is equally important. My enhancements across software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database design reflect that mindset.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Collaboration and communication have been critical components of my development. Through peer discussions, code reviews, and project presentations, I learned how to explain technical decisions clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. The code review included in this portfolio demonstrates my ability to walk through existing functionality, identify areas for improvement, and justify enhancements in a structured way. These communication skills are essential for working in quality assurance and testing roles where documenting issues and explaining defects clearly is just as important as identifying them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the area of software engineering and design, I improved the structure and organization of my original artifact by separating responsibilities across model, view, and controller-style components. This refactoring improved readability, maintainability, and scalability. It also reflects industry best practices that are important in testing environments where code clarity directly impacts the ability to validate behavior and isolate defects.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For algorithms and data structures, I focused on improving filtering logic and data handling within the application. By restructuring how data was processed and ensuring efficient operations using appropriate data structures, I enhanced both performance and reliability. This experience strengthened my understanding of how algorithmic decisions affect scalability and responsiveness an important consideration when testing applications under varying data loads.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the database enhancement, I implemented MongoDB indexing and full-text search capabilities. This required a deeper understanding of how databases retrieve and optimize data. I also improved how the application interacts with the database, ensuring cleaner queries and better error handling. These changes demonstrate my ability to work with modern database technologies while keeping performance and security in mind.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Security awareness has become an important part of how I think about software. Throughout this project, I considered risks such as hardcoded credentials, improper data handling, and missing validation. Even small improvements such as structured queries, controlled access to data, and defensive checks in callbacks reflect a proactive approach to anticipating issues before they become failures. This mindset is directly aligned with the responsibilities of a Test Engineer, where identifying vulnerabilities and weaknesses is a core objective.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Overall, the artifacts included in this ePortfolio represent my growth across multiple areas of computer science and demonstrate how those areas connect together. The software engineering enhancement improved structure and maintainability, the algorithms enhancement improved efficiency and data handling, and the database enhancement strengthened performance and data management. Together, they showcase my ability to analyze an existing system, identify weaknesses, and implement meaningful improvements.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This capstone experience has helped me transition from thinking like a student completing assignments to thinking like an engineer responsible for quality, performance, and long-term sustainability. As I move into a career as a Test Engineer, I bring not only technical skills in software development and database design, but also a mindset focused on validation, reliability, and continuous improvement.
